# E-Commerce Case
An Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
#### This is a Linear Regression model to predict 'Yearly Amount Spent' by a customer and analyze the factors on which it depends so that the company can decide whether to focus on their mobile app or their website.
